<p>Bellis perennis, commonly known as the common or English daisy, is a charming perennial herb native to Europe that typically reaches about 20 cm in height, sporting a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and producing hair-covered stems bearing single 2–3 cm composite flowers—white ray florets encircling a bright yellow disc. It blooms mainly from March to July, favoring full sun to partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, though it is sensitive to drought and heat. Widely naturalized across temperate regions, it often appears in lawns and meadows and can be hard to eliminate due to its creeping rhizomes and prolific seed production. The plant has culinary and medicinal uses (leaves and petals in salads or teas), and culturally, it symbolizes purity and loyal love—underscored by the timeless “he loves me…he loves me not” game—despite often being labeled a persistent lawn weed.</p>
